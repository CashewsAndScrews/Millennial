One of the first DIY projects we did together was painting a $2 coffee table. Now that we have our own place, we decided to get an upgrade and make our own live edge wooden coffee table. We're also working on a matching dining table, so watch out for that!

**Materials**

* Live edge slab. We got a nice maple slab from [Berkshire Products](www.berkshireproducts.com) in the southwest corner of MA for about $250. Make sure your slab is completely dried before using! 
* Hairpin legs from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Heavy-Hairpin-Satin-Century-Modern/dp/B013VNLC4K/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=hardware&ie=UTF8&qid=1506995865&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=hairpin+legs&psc=1)
* 16 #8 1-inch wood screws and drill. (This can be shorter/longer depending on the thickness of your slab!)
* Electric palm sander with 80, 120 and 220 grit sand paper. 
* 0000 steel wool from Home Depot
* Steel brush (like a BBQ brush)
* An oil-based, clear sealant from [Rockler's](http://www.rockler.com/general-finishes-original-seal-a-cell-clear)
* Oil and urethane semi-gloss topcoat also from [Rockler's](http://www.rockler.com/general-finishes-arm-r-seal-urethane-topcoat-semi-gloss)
*A ton of foam brushes

**Instructions**
1. Cut your slab to the desired length. We were lucky and Berkshire Products did this for us on site with a circular saw. Most places will do this for free. (You can see our slab had a little water damage due to our basement flooding. Luckily it sanded out!)

2. Use the steel brush to remove any weak or rotting bark from the live edge. You don't want to sand this part down.

3. Sand the crap out of both sides of the table, beginning with the 80 grit and working your way to the 220 grit. We did at least 6 passes with each grit. We also needed masks and some good ventilation for this part. You'll want to sand both sides because you want the pores to equally absorb your sealant. This will reduce warping over time.

4. Wipe one side of the table very clean using paper towels or a microfiber cloth.
5. Use a paper towel to rub sealant all over one side, as well as the edges. We recommend starting with your top side, because the edges will drip to the bottom. Wipe off all excess sealant so it appears dry. Allow to dry for a day.
6. Flip the table over and apply sealant to the other wide using the same method. We did not do this step, but we think our result would have been cleaner if we did.
7. Flip back to the top-side up and apply the first layer of topcoat. Use a foam brush to lightly apply topcoat in the direction of the grain. Go over with a dry brush to remove excess. Allow to dry one day.
8. Lightly sand the topcoat using the steel wool, and apply 2 more layers. Do not sand the final layer.
9. Make sure in these steps to also apply topcoat to the edges of your table. You can be more generous here with the application.

10. Repeat steps 7-8 for the other side.
11. Attach hairpin legs to bottom of table using the 16 screws. You will need to drill a pilot hole -- be careful not to drill all the way through the table!

Weare really happy with the way this turned out!
