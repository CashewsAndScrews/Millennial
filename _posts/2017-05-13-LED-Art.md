We had a few meters of fully programmable rgb LED strips left over from a product design class, so we figured we could make some sort of hipster art with it. First we thought, hey we could just lay these out in a grid and have a big programmable pixel array, and then we thought it would look cooler if we stuck a piece of canvas in front of it, just to diffuse the light. So that’s what we did.

**Materials**

* Arduino (pretty much any will do, as long as it has some PWM outputs) We used and atmega 256, but that’s way overkill.
* LED light strips (there are probably multiple sellers of this sort of thing, but these are what we had on hand, and they were convenient because they took 5V input, which can also be used to power the arduino). We had five meters to work with.
* Electrical wire, at least four colors
* Canvas
* Fiber board – cut to the same size as the canvas
* 10 Amp,  5V DC power supply. We used an old laptop 24V power supply, and we bought a 24 to 5 V converter.
* A long cord with a switch. We bought a cheap hanging light on amazon to use.
* Two 3-4 inch bolts with 4 nuts to hang the canvas. We used 5/32 bolts, but you can use anything.
* Tons of Duct Tape
* Soldering iron
* 1/2 inch wooden dowel – at least as long as the length of the canvas
* Zipties

**Instructions**

1. Cut up LED strips into as many pieces as will fit on your fiber board back.  The LED strips should have clear sections where it is easy to cut that leave you with convenient spots to solder onto. You can cut these strips with scissors. With our 5 meter, we made 6 strips and left about an inch for a boarder.

2. Evenly space your LED strips vertically and duct tape them onto the board. Be careful to not cover any LEDs! Also, do not use colored tape because it will make your final picture tinted.
3. You should have 4 colored wires. Write down a color for the ground, the digital input, the clock and the 5 V wires.

4. On the right side of each strip, solder the grounds to each other. Then do the same with the 5 V inputs.

5. Solder the digital inputs together into a “snake” pattern across the board. Do the same with the clock inputs
6. Solder some longer wires onto the digital input and clock inputs at the start of the “snake”. These will plug into the Arduino, so it is easiest if you use solder core wire.
7. Mount the Arduino with Duct tape onto the back of the board.

8. Plug in the clock input and digital input wires into PWM Arduino outputs.
9. Cut the plug and socket off of the hanging light cord you bought. Strip the ends. Attach the power and ground wire from this cord on one end into the 5V output on your 24 V to 5 V converter.
10. Solder the power wire from the cord on the other end onto on of the 5 V input on the LED strips. Solder the ground wire from the cord onto one of the ground inputs on the LED strips.
11. Solder longer wires onto on the ground input and 5 V input from one of the LED. Plug the 5 V wire you just made into the 5 V input on the arduino (labeled 5 V). Plug the ground wire you just made into one of the grounds on the arduino. Do not mix any of these wires up, or you may fry your Arduino/LEDS!
12. Strip the end of your 24 V supply and attach it to your 5 V converter.
13. Drill holes in the top corners of your fiberboard, ~ the same size as your screws. You don’t actually need a drill- you can make a hole by twisting a knife point or pointy screwdriver into the fiber board. Space the holes so that the spacing is equal to the inner corners of your canvas frame.

14. Thread nuts onto your screws, leaving them ~1 inch from the head of the screw. Push the screws through the holes from the back of the board. Thread on the other nuts, and tighten down so that the screws are locked in place.
15. Drill a couple more hoes in the center of your board, about an inch apart vertically. Thread a zip tie from the front through the holes.

16. Place the dowel horizontally onto the back of your board and tie the ziptie to secure it.
17. Now you will need to program your Arduino. You can get started with the code we have here. You will need to change the code so that it has the same number of LEDs in your own display, and the same pins you plugged your digital input and clock input into on your own Arduino.

18. Hang up your board, wedge the canvas on it, plug it in, flip it on, and your done!
19. Unless it’s not working, then troubleshoot.
 

You can easily change the background of this board, and even incorporate animations with our code. Have fun creating!
