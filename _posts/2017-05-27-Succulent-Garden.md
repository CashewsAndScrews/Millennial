Inspired by many Pinterest boards, Alex and I decided to build a large succulent window box garden. We had already been collecting succulents over the last two years, and our previous shelf was getting crowded.

## Supply List:
1. 30'' sheet metal planters x2
2. 6 L brackets
3. 6 ft. of 2x1 in. lumber
4. 1'' Wood screws
5. Drywall anchors
6. Styrofoam peanuts
7. Cactus soil
8. Around 40 small succulents


## Instructions: 

To begin, we got most of what we needed for the project at [Mahoney's Garden Center](http://mahoneysgarden.com/) (including even more succulents...) and Home Depot.

Our plan was to mount two white 30'' metal planters to the wall using standard shelving brackets. Our house is incredibly curvey, so we took extra time to level the brackets. We secured each bracket with three 35 lb. drywall anchors.

Our planters have a small lip around the bottom edges, meaning that they would not lie flat on the brackets. To get around this, we screwed a wood 2 inch wood plank onto the brackets that fit within the lips and mount onto the flat bottoms of the planters.

We aligned the planters on the wood planks and drilled four holes through the metal bottom of the planters. We put a wood screw through each hole into the planks to secure the planters.

Our planters do not have any built-in drainage, which is important for succulents! To create a drainage system, we filled the bottom third of each planter with foam pieces. You can use styrofoam for this step, but we did not have any. Instead we painfully tore apart a large block of plastic foam we had around. Do *not* use any biodegradable foam peanuts, as they will dissolve when you water the succulents! We filled the rest of the planter with cactus potting soil.

Finally, the fun part of arranging the succulents! We had 48 plants in total for our two planters. We arranged the larger succulents first and used the smaller ones to fill empty spaces.

The project turned out great! The space is much brighter and less cluttered than before. Let us know if you have any questions or comments!
