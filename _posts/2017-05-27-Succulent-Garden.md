Inspired by many Pinterest boards, Alex and I decided to build a large succulent window box garden. We had already been collecting succulents over the last two years, and our previous shelf was getting crowded. 

To begin, we got most of what we needed for the project at [Mahoney's Garden Center](http://mahoneysgarden.com/) (including even more succulents...) and Home Depot.

Our house is incredibly curvey, so we took extra time to level the brackets which hold the planters.

Our planters have small lips around the edges, meaning that they would not lie flat on the brackets. To get around this [wood...]






We got two white metal 30'' planters, which were our cheapest option that weren't plastic. They don't have drainage holes, but more on that later.
